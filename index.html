        <h1>Top Reasons To Choose Wildlife Conservation Volunteering Projects</h1>

                Volunteering with animals can be incorporated with fabulous destinations.
                From marine conservation off the Mediterranean coast to the wildlife and 
                rescue center in the lush lands of Costa Rica, volunteering to work with 
                animals can have you explore more of a countryâ€™s beauty than traditional 
                tourist visits.  You will be able to enjoy nature from a different viewpoint
                than the traditional rush of vacations that may take you quickly from one
                place to the next.

                    How else would we have the opportunity to ride, wash and feed an elephant? 
                    There are programs working with elephants in Surin, and Chiang Mai, Thailand
                    and in Sri Lanka. Other programs include working with large game in South
                    Africa, with manatees in Peru, or with rescued primates, bears, and exotic 
                    birds in Vietnam.

                    You will meet others that are as passionate as you are about working with
                    animals.  It can be hard at times to express to others the value you have 
                    for animal life and their protection.  Working closely with the staff and 
                    other volunteers you are sure to make friends from around the world that 
                    share your dedication and commitment to the preservation of wildlife.
